# Improving an Existing Technical Support Process

## Why map the process?

Process mapping gets everyone on the same page. The anaylsis reduces information silos, improves processes, reduces/eliminates rework, improves adoption, and increases user enagement. For more details on the WHY, WHAT, and HOW can be found in the README here: [repository](https://github.com/sbvegan/dao-process-mapping).

## Approach

**The cycle**:

1. Analyze
1. Build
1. Deliver
1. Operate
1. Run it back

**Identify and map** the process as-is and then improve. Workshop:

- Gather the team who currently manage the process and can provide input about the process.
- Gather all necessary information:
    - Where does the process begin and end?
    - What steps need to be taken between the beginning and the end?
    - What are the I/O of the process?
    - Who needs to do what and when do they need to do it?
- Develop the process map, draw the process with a focus on the order of the steps from beginning to end.

**Once the process is mapped** 

- Analyze the process map to identify inefficiencies/bottlenecks. Where can we make improvements or what steps can be removed?
- Develop new, better steps. Begin with *small steps* and if you see improvements, try scaling to reach a broader audience.
- Manage the process. Monitor performance and identify where it needs improvement.

## Version control

Version control can also be applied to the process map to see how it evolves over time and to rollback when a bug in the system is introduced. We can try apply SemVer:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR - increment when we make an incompatible change

MINOR - increment when we add backwards-compatible functionality

PATCH - increment when making backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Changelog

With changes, we'll maintain a changelog so we can have a historical record of process updates. This acts a communication tool for the relevant parties.
